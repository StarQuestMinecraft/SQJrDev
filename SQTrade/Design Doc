Objective:
	To encourage player-player trade
Gameplay Design Decisions:
	The Basic Process:
		The player builds a multiblock structure called a trade hub and binds it to him/herself
		The player can run a command (/tradehub) from anywhere in the game to search buy/sell orders
		Players can complete (or partially complete) orders of other players
	The Trade Hub:
		The trade hub is a multiblock structure that has the following items:
			An emerald block and possibly other filler blocks
			An output chest
			An input chest
			A button for placing buy orders
			A sign for linking the trade hub to oneself
	Placing a Buy Order:
		To place a buy order, press the button that's part of your trade hub, search for the item that you want to buy, and select the amount you wish to buy EACH INDIVIDUAL UNIT for (using clickable chat)
		You also select the quantity of items you wish to buy (using clickable chat)
		Your credits are taken up front
		There is additionally an option to remotely press the buy button using /tradehub
	Placing a Sell Order:
		To place a sell order, open the chest that's part of your trade hub, put in the items that you want to sell, and select the amount you wish to sell EACH INDIVIDUAL UNIT for (using clickable chat)
		The items disappear and are "stored" inside the trade hub
		There is NOT an option to remotely open the sell chest using /tradehub
	Deleting an Order:
		There is an option to delete an order using /tradehub
		Your items/credits are fully refunded after deleting an order
		Items from the refund go into the output chest
	Modifying an order:
		The only way to modify an order is to delete it and place it again
	Completing an Order:
		To complete another player's order, simply fly to their trade hub, click on the sign, and click on the order you wish to fill
		Select a quantity (using clickable chat) to buy/sell and complete the transaction
		The items/credits are deducted from your inventory/bank and your payment goes directly into your inventory/bank
	Trade Hub Interface:
		Access with /tradehub
		9 slot inventory - contains options for:
			Place Sell Order:
				Opens an inventory with 27 slots to put items into
				Upon closing the inventory, the player chooses the amount to sell EACH INDIVIDUAL ITEM for (using clickable chat)
				The clickable chat expires after 1 minute (or if you press cancel) and the items are put back in the player's inventory
				Should the player's inventory be full, the remaining items are dropped on the ground
			Place Buy Order:
				Sends the player a message - "To place a buy order, type /buyitem <id> <amount> [damage]"
				The id can be in either the new format or the old format
				If the player types a valid id, a confirmation GUI will pop up confirming that the player has the right item
				If the player confirms, the player chooses the amount to buy EACH INDIVIDUAL ITEM for (using clickable chat)
				The clickable chat expires after 1 minute (or if you press cancel)
				The player doesn't have to navigate through the GUI to place a buy order. Typing /buyitem <id> <amount> [damage] is enough
			Delete Order:
				Opens an inventory with 9 slots containing the player's various orders
				The items shown are the items being bought/sold
				The items are titled either Buy Order or Sell order
				The lore of the items is formatted as follows:
					Filled: <filled>/<total>
					Unit Price: <price>
					Coordinates: (<x>, <y>, <z>)
				Clicking on an item brings up a deletion confirmation
				Clicking yes will delete the order
				Clicking no will close the GUI
				Items/Credits are refunded
				You cannot delete an order if your inventory is full
	Additional Notes:
		You cannot sell/buy more than 27 stacks using one order
		You cannot deliver to a trade hub if there is not enough room in the output chest
		Likewise, you cannot delete an order if there is not enough room in the output chest
		You cannot buy from a trade hub if there is not enough room in your inventory
		You can only have 9 orders at any given time
Technical Design Decisions:

				static Inventory getDeletionInventory(Player player)
				Contains other methods for clickable chat and anything that has to do with /tradehub
		Structure:
			Contains the static method is valid that accepts a Location and returns true if the Location contains the sign of a valid trade hub
		OrderFiller:
			Handles dropping off/picking up items
		TradesSaver:
			static void save() - called onDisable() to save all trades
